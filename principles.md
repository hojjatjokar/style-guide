## The principle of Least Privilege
This principle is also known as the principle of least exposure. and means giving a function, or a process, only those privileges which are essential to perform its intended function. This is important to make sure about the security of your application. Also this will keep the code easy to maintain by not creating peer dependency between the functions.
